ASIAN GROUND BEEF, MUSHROOM, AND BROCCOLI SLAW LETTUCE CUPS from Nom Nom Paleo

Assemble these ingredients:

1 lb of ground meat (I used grass fed ground beef)
1 lb of thinly sliced mushrooms (I used cremini)
1 small onion, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons of lard
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1-2 cups of broccoli slaw (I use the organic slaw from Trader Joe’s)
½ cup of shredded carrots (I use the ones from Trader Joe’s)
2 scallions, thinly sliced
a handful of cilantro, coarsely chopped
1-2 tablespoons of fish sauce
1-2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
1-2 tablespoons of coconut aminos
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper


Here’s what I did with everything:

The first step was finely chopping my onion in my mini prep food processor.  Whenever I make grass fed ground beef, I like to really pulverize the onions.  This helps moisten the meat and it cooks so much faster.

Then, I put the onions into my skillet with some melted lard and sautéed on medium heat until translucent.  Then, I added the sliced mushrooms and some salt and pepper.  When the onions and mushrooms had cooked off the excess moisture, I added the minced garlic cloves and stirred everything around for 30 seconds. 

Next, I added the ground beef and stirred that around until there weren’t big clumps and it was no longer pink.   I added the fish sauce, apple cider vinegar, and coconut aminos and then tasted for seasoning.  I put about equal amounts of all three and then I cracked on some freshly ground black pepper.

Once the meat was cooked and seasoned, I added the broccoli slaw and shredded carrots and stirred everything around to soften the veggies a little.   I added the herby goodness (scallions and cilantro) last and mixed to distribute everything.

I spooned the beef and veggie mixture onto red butter lettuce leaves (my favorite lettuce for this kind of recipe)…

…and squeezed on some Paleo Sriracha sauce.
